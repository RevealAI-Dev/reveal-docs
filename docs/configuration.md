# Configuration

The Reveal widget can be integrated into your website in two ways:

1. [Floating Widget](./floating-widget) - A widget that appears in the corner of your website and expands when clicked
2. [Embedded Component](./embedded-component) - A component that can be embedded directly into your page layout

Choose the integration method that best suits your website design and user experience requirements.
